                  <p>This is the place for you to learn more about this effort, as well as what else we do at Pratham Books, 
                  in our mission to place a book in every child’s hand.
                  </p>

                  <p>Pratham Books was founded with the ambition of putting a book in every child’s hand. To this end, 
                  we’ve spent a decade creating exciting, accessible stories for children, in languages they can relate to, 
                  and building a system that reaches them, all across the length and breadth of India. Along the way, 
                  we came to realise that there are thousands of people who would love to help children read, but are unaware of how they can help. 
                  </p>

                  <p>This led to the idea of a crowd-funding initiative – this initiative! – that would make it easy to help 
                  India’s children read. All a donor would have to do is come to the site, pick an NGO, librarian, or a Reading 
                  Champion they would like to support, and a few clicks would have them ordering a batch of books for a group of 
                  children to discover, read, and enjoy!
                  </p>

                  <p>Our sole aim is to see more Indian children read, and that is why beneficiaries don’t pay us a rupee to 
                  receive their books. Every rupee donated on this platform goes towards the books, and ensuring they reach the 
                  children for whom they are meant. 
                  </p>

                  At Pratham Books, we believe that every child has the right to enjoy good books.  And we believe they should have stories 
                  set in surroundings familiar to them and in a language close to their culture. We believe that to make books accessible 
                  to every child, the price points have to be very low. Pratham Books is a brand of story books as Indian as the children 
                  who read them. As a not-for-profit publisher, our dream is to see a country where every child wants to read, is able to 
                  read, and has something good to read.<br/><br/>

                  With a range of stories created to excite children with different likes and tastes, the books are illustrated by some of 
                  the most enthusiastic and talented illustrators. Our aim is to have something good for every child, in every part of the 
                  country, and in the process spread the joy of reading far and wide.<br/><br/>

                  Till date, Pratham Books has published over 280 titles in English and 10 other Indian languages. That's over 1800 unique 
                  books, most of which are priced below Rs 35. We have printed over 12 million books, over 11 million story cards and have 
                  a readership of nearly 52 million. Our vision is to reach 200 million children in India, and we hope to someday put <strong>'a book 
                    in every child's hand'</strong>.<br/><br/>

                      We have a number of beneficiaries listed who are running their campaigns from different parts of the country. You 
                      can choose a beneficiary whom you wish to donate to basis the geography : state or urband vs rural, or their total 
                      requirement or the scope of their work (Govt organisation vs Individual raisers). You can filter your choices also 
                      basis the language they are seeking books for. Use our ‘Easy Browse’ filter to narrow down your choices.
                      You could also lend  a hand to organisations who are least funded or whose campaigns are going to end soon.

                    <div> 
                      <p>
                      As soon as the campaign ends, the process of delivery of books to the beneficiary will begin from our end. 
                      In less than a month, the books should be with the children. We encourage the beneficiary to put up a 
                      report on usage on the page which you can go through. You can also contact the beneficiary directly for any update.

                    <div>
                      <p>
                      No. The option of choosing the books lies only with the Beneficiary as they know their children and their needs 
                      the best. Basis their requirement they choose a mix of books in various languages and levels.
                      </p>

                    <div>
                      <p>
                      Yes, if you want them to. We have an option of donating anonymously which you can tick if you would prefer to 
                      keep your donation anonymous. Else, your name and message (if any) will be captured and will reflect on the 
                      beneficiary page.

                      There are no physical rewards if that’s what you meant.

                    </div>

                    <h4>8. Can I change my chosen beneficiary or cancel my donation?</h4>

                      Once you have made the donation and paid via your bank a/c, no change or cancellation is possible.
                      </p>

                    <div>
                      <p>
                      Yes, very much. Donating for a cause is the best gift to give someone. 
                      You can choose to donate on their behalf by mentioning their name as the Donor while making the payment.

                      that content from the Company records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that 
                      they were copied or stored by other users. You also agree that we are required under applicable laws to store 
                      (if not publicly display or distribute) the Content, User Submissions and your other information or data for certain

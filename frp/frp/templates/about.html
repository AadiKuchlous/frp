                  <p> <strong> Donate-a-Book </strong> is an initiative by Pratham Books to help bridge the gap between those 
                  who want to help children read and those who need books for children. Together we will build a Reading India by 
                  making storybooks accessible to thousands of children and spread the joy of reading.
                  </p>

                  <p>Pratham Books was founded with the mission of putting &#8220a book in every child’s hand&#8221. To this end, 
                  we’ve spent a decade creating exciting, engaging stories for children, in Indian languages, 
                  and creating access to them, all across the length and breadth of India. Along the way, 
                  we came to realise that there are thousands of people who would love to help children read, but are 
                  unaware of how to do so.
                  </p>

                  <p>This led to the idea of a crowd-funding initiative – this initiative! That would make it easy to help 
                  India’s children read. All a donor needs to do is pick an NGO, librarian, or a Reading 
                  Champion they would like to support, and with a few clicks send them a set of books that a group of 
                  children can discover, read, and enjoy!
                  </p>

                  <p>Our sole aim is to see more Indian children read, and that is why every rupee donated on this platform 
                  goes towards the books, and ensuring they reach the children for whom they are meant. 
                  </p>

                  <p>At <strong> Donate-a-Book </strong> we connect those who need children's books across India, 
                  with those who can help get these books to them.

                  Pratham Books is a non-profit organisation that publishes high quality, affordable books for children in 
                  multiple Indian languages. We believe that every child has the right to enjoy good books with stories 
                  set in surroundings familiar to them and in languages they speak and learn in. We also believe that to make books accessible 
                  to every child, the price points have to be very low. Pratham Books publishes storybooks as Indian as the children 
                  who read them. As a not-for-profit publisher, our dream is to see a country where every child wants to read, is able to 
                  read, and has something good to read.<br/><br/>

                  With a wide range of stories created to appeal to children, our books cover a range of genres from fiction to
                  science, history, mathematics and nature. We have had the distinction of working with many of 
                  the country's renowned authors and illustrators and our books have won several awards as well.  <br/><br/>

                  Till date, Pratham Books has published hundreds of original titles in 16 languages and most are
                  are priced below Rs 35/-. We have spread the joy of reading to millions of children across the country. 
                  Our mission is to reach 200 million children in India, and we hope to someday put 
                  <strong>'a book in every child's hand'</strong>.<br/><br/>

                    <div> 
                      <p>
                      If you are an individual or an organisation that works with children in India, and seek help to spread the joy of 
                      reading to these children, then you are eligible! You do not necessarily have to be a registered charity to build a 
                      campaign.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>2. How long does it take to set up? </h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      You will have to fill our simple 3 step beneficiary form which will help us identify you and your work. Once the campaign is created, 
                      it will take us 2 to 3 working days for us to verify it. Once verified, your campaign goes live, and you can start 
                      spreading the word about it.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>3. How much does it cost? </h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      There is no fee for setting up a fund-raising campaign. You can set up your campaign for free and get donations for 
                      the books you require.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>4. How long does a campaign run? </h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      The average duration of a campaign to be featured on Donate-a-Book is 30 days 
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>5. What are the ways in which I can promote my campaign to increase donations? </h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      Once the campaign is up, start sharing it with your circle of friends and well wishers requesting them to donate for 
                      the campaign. You could also send out emailers or run awareness campaigns on your social media to raise 
                      awareness about your campaign. Pratham Books will also be spreading a word about the running campaigns on its 
                      social media along with targeted emailers to help you achieve your fund raising goal.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>6. What if I don’t achieve my set target? </h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      Even if you don’t achieve 100% of your target, you are eligible to get books of the amount you 
                      have already raised funds for. For example, if your target amount for Rs.10,000/- but at the end of your campaign period you 
                      could raise only Rs.7500/-, you can still choose books for that amount. Books worth Rs.7500/- would reach you.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>7. In how many days will I get the books? </h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      After your campaign is over, a list of in-stock books will be sent to you. 
                      You are required to revert within 10 working  days with your choice and preference of books required. 
                      Once we get your list, the books will reach you within 30 working days.

                    <div> 
                      <p>
                      We have a number of beneficiaries listed who are running their campaigns from different parts of the country. You 
                      can choose a beneficiary whom you wish to donate for, on the basis of geography, or their total 
                      requirement or the scope of their work (Not-for-Profit organisation vs Individuals). You can filter your choice on the
                      basis of the language requirement of books too.
                      You could also lend a hand to organisations which are least funded or whose campaigns are going to end soon. Refer to our
                      <a href="{{url_for('discover', category='featured') }}">Featured</a> or

                    </div>

                    <h4>3. How can I be sure the organisation that I am donating to is genuine?</h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      Before a campaign is live on the platform, we do a background check on the applying beneficiaries to ensure that 
                      only real and genuine organisations feature on Donate-a-Book. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      The due diligence is carried out in these two steps:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Step1: By looking up the organisation's website/Facebook page /Blog and doing a bit of research on their content and footprint.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Step 2: By contacting people working at the organisation through the phone numbers provided by them. We usually ask them 
                      to elaborate a little on the work they do, alongside gauging their plans for this funding.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      This is to ensure that your money goes to a genuine organisation in need of books.
                      Please note, due to a small team with base only in two cities, we DO NOT do any physical verification of the beneficiaries.
                      However, we have been working in the development sector now for over 10 years and either know most of these organisations, or 
                      are able to verify their authenticity through our network.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>4. How can I be sure my donation is reaching the correct organisation?</h4>
                    <div> 
                      <p>
                      As soon as the campaign ends, the process of delivery of books to the beneficiary will begin from our end. 
                      In less than a month, the books should be with the children. You can contact the beneficiary directly for any update. 
                      Pratham Books has been working in the space of children book publishing for over 10 years and is a not-for-profit organisation 
                      with huge credibility in the sector.

                    <h4>5. Can I choose the books that I want to donate?</h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      The option of choosing the books lies only with the Beneficiary as they know their children and their needs 
                      the best. Based on their requirement they will choose a mix of books in various languages and levels.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>6. Would the beneficiary know I am donating to them?</h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      Yes, if you want them to. We have an option of donating anonymously which you can tick if you would prefer to 
                      keep your donation anonymous. Else, your name and amount of the donation will be conveyed to the beneficiary.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>7. Will I get anything in return?</h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      The joy of knowing that you have helped more children in India read, is the biggest reward that your contribution will get you. 
                      There are no physical rewards if that’s what you mean.
                      </p>

                    <h4>8. When does my money reach the beneficiary?</h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      The books that are brought from your donation reach the beneficiary within 30 days from the day their campaign ends.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>9. Can I change my chosen beneficiary or cancel my donation?</h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      Once you have made the donation and paid via your bank a/c or, credit/debit crad, no change or cancellation is possible.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>10. Can I make a donation on someone else’s behalf?</h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                      Yes, very much. Donating for a cause is the best gift to give someone. 
                      You can choose to donate on their behalf by mentioning their name as the donor while making the payment.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      As per the Section 115BBC of Income Tax Act 1961, Pratham Books is liable to maintain the Name, Address and

                      and maintain all records as required by the applicable law. Hence taking details of your Pan Card with every 
                      donation you make is a mandatory legal requirement. Don't worry, all your personal data is safe with us and will 
                      never be shared with a third party. Refer to our <a href="/about#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more on this.

                    <div>
                      <p>
                      If you have opted to get the Tax Exemption Receipt by clicking 'yes' in the donor form, you are on our list. We are
                      currently looking to automate the Tax Exemption Receipt system on the website, post which you will get e-receipts 
                      of all your donations on Donate-a-Book. This automation will take a little while and we are looking at issuing receipts 
                      post October 2015. In case you require a receipt before that, please write to donateabook@prathambooks.org and we 
                      will ensure a physical receipt reaches you within 6-7 working days.

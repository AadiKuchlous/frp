Dear Mr/MS. {{first_name}},

Woohoo ! Your Donate-a-Book campaign is now Live. 
Click on the link to see how does your campaign page displays http://donateabook.org.in{{url_for('campaign', id=id) }}
If you are not able to go to the link please copy paste link on browser window
 
Here are a few tips to make sure your Campaign hits the target:-
 
Personalize your Campaign Page. Talk about your organization and the work you do. Narrate an impact story.
Share your Campaign link on social media (Facebook,Twitter,Google+) with a brief description on what are you raising the funds for.
Attach an impact story with your campaign. An impact story helps donors in making quick decision.
Do you have a blog? Write a post on your campaign and your fund raising efforts. Every appeal helps.
Similarly, if your donors have a blog, ask them to write about you.
Sometimes appeals slip by the first time. Do not hesitate to send at least one follow up email.

Here are a few pitfalls you should avoid:-
Do not spam emails or social networking sites. Sharing your project and talking about it is good but a limit needs to be set so that it doesnâ€™t become an annoyance for others.
Do not make your appeal too long or too descriptive lest donors lose interest.
Do not jeopardize other campaigns or promote your own campaign on their page.
Be cognizant of day to day internet manners.

 Still have a query? Drop in a mail at donateabook@prathambooks.org.
 We wish you all the best for your campaign.



Regards,
Donate-A-Book Team

    <h3> About Pratham Books </h3>
    <p>
    <strong> Pratham Books </strong> is a non-profit organisation that publishes high quality,
    affordable books for children in multiple Indian languages. We believe 
    that every child has the right to enjoy good books with stories set in 
    surroundings familiar to them and in languages they speak and learn in. 
    We also believe that to make books accessible to every child, the price 
    points have to be very low. Pratham Books publishes storybooks as 
    Indian as the children who read them. As a not-for-profit publisher, our 
    dream is to see a country where every child wants to read, is able to 
    read, and has something good to read.<a href="http://www.prathambooks.org" target="_blank"> (more) </a>

      <a href="http://blog.prathambooks.org/2014/11/our-books-reach-e-base-library-in-pench.html" target="_blank">E Base Library</a>
      </p>
      <p>
      The E-Base library is an attempt to open up the world of books to the students of 
      Pench. The importance of reading for a holistic education cannot be discounted and the 
      E-Base library strives to fill this gap that exists by bringing to the students books 
      from all around the world. This is the first time the students of this region have a 
      library at their doorstep. Would you want to start a Library too?

    <h3>Become a Reading Champion</h3>
    <p>
    Engage with us to spread the joy of storytelling by becoming a Pratham Books' 
    Reading Champion. Through this champions program we encourage our community of 
    volunteers to conduct reading sessions under the ‘One Day, One Story’ event 
    that we do to celebrate the International Literacy Day on September 6th. These 
    sessions are conducted free of cost and mostly with children from under-served 
    communities. The Pratham Books' Champions program is a one-of its kind 
    volunteer program that has scaled to a national level with more and more 
    volunteers wanting to join us in this movement.

      </p>
      <p>The E-Base library is a humble attempt to open up the world of books to 
      the students of Pench. The importance of reading for a holistic education cannot 
      be discounted and the E-Base library strives to fill this gap that exists by bringing 
      to the students books from all around the world. This is the first time the students of this 
      region have a library at their doorstep. Would you want to start a Library too?

    <h3>Become a Reading Champion</h3>
    <p>
    Engage with us to spread the joy of storytelling by becoming a Pratham Books' 
    Reading Champion. Through this champions program we encourage our community of 
    volunteers to conduct reading sessions under the ‘One Day, One Story’ event 
    that we do to celebrate the International Literacy Day on September 6th. These 
    sessions are conducted free of cost and mostly with children from under-served 
    communities. The Pratham Books' Champions program is a one-of its kind 
    volunteer program that has scaled to a national level with more and more 
    volunteers wanting to join us in this movement.
